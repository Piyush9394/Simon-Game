# Simon Game

A simple, interactive **Simon Game** built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. This game tests your memory and reaction time by challenging you to repeat an increasing sequence of colors.

## 🎮 How to Play  
1. Press any key to start the game.  
2. Watch the sequence of colors flash on the screen.  
3. Click the colors in the exact order they appeared.  
4. If you get it right, the sequence will get longer and the game will speed up.  
5. If you make a mistake, the game resets, and you can try again!  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Increasing Difficulty** – The speed increases as you progress beyond level 5, 10, and 15.  
✅ **Interactive UI** – Colorful buttons with smooth animations.  
✅ **Sound Effects** – Each button has a unique sound.  
✅ **Game Over Effect** – The screen flashes red when you lose.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – For structuring the game.  
- **CSS** – For styling and animations.  
- **JavaScript (jQuery)** – For game logic and user interaction.
